web text 및 인간의 지식이 확장됨에 따라, RE의 "more"이 필요해짐

## 1 Introduction

the real world is much more complicated than this simple setting:

(1) collecting high-quality human annotations is expensive and time-consuming,

- human annotation을 적게 또는 사용하지 않는 방향으로 -> Utilizing More Data

(2) many long-tail relations cannot provide large amounts of training examples,

- 길고 복잡한 관계 보완 → Handling More Complicated Context

(3) most facts are expressed by long context consisting of multiple sentences,

- 다수의 문장에 걸쳐 표현되는 관계들 → Performing More Efficient Learning

and moreover (4) using a pre-defined set to cover those relations with open-ended growth is difficult.

   →Orienting More Open Domains

→ 이들을 보완하기 위한 further study 필요

## 2 Background and Existing Work

### 2.1 Pattern Extraction Models

### 2.2 Statistical Relation Extraction Models (SRE)

- feature-based methods
- kernel-based methods
- Graphical methods
- encoding text into low-dimensional semantic spaces and extracting relations from textual embeddings

### 2.3 Neural Relation Extraction Models (NRE)

NRE에 word embedding이 사용된다; position embeddings 등

- RNN
- CNN
- GNN
- attention-based neural networks
- Transformers, pre-trained language models
